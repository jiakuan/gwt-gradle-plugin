# GWT Gradle Plugin (v2)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jiakuan/gwt-gradle-plugin/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jiakuan/gwt-gradle-plugin/actions)

The **GWT Gradle Plugin** (v2) simplifies the configuration required to build
projects with the [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/). This
version is a complete rewrite of the original plugin, offering a cleaner
codebase and more intuitive configuration options.

## Key Features

- **Minimal configuration** required to use the plugin
- **Simpler codebase** compared to the v1 plugin
- No need to manually add core GWT dependencies like `gwt-user`, `gwt-dev` and `gwt-codeserver`
- **Enhanced source tracking** for GWT Modules. This feature enables targeted
  tracking of source code specifically related to GWT modules. Only the source
  paths defined within each GWT module are monitored, ensuring that the
  gwtCompile task is triggered only when relevant GWT source files are modified.
  This refined tracking minimizes unnecessary recompilation by focusing solely
  on changes within GWT-specific code, optimizing the build process for faster
  iterations and more efficient resource usage.
- **Configuration aligned with GWT compiler options** for ease of use
- **Support for GWT 2.12+** and the latest Gradle 8.13 (minimum Gradle version is 8.1)
- Built-in tasks for GWT compilation and dev mode

## Usage

The **GWT Gradle Plugin** is available on
the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.docstr.gwt).

To use this plugin, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```
plugins {
  id "org.docstr.gwt" version "2.2.0"
}

gwt {
  // Optional: Set the GWT version, defaults to 2.12.1
  // gwtVersion = '2.12.1'
  modules ['<YOUR-GWT-MODULE>']
}
```

Alternatively, you can apply the plugin using the legacy method:

```
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "org.docstr.gwt:gwt-gradle-plugin:2.2.0"
  }
}

apply plugin: "org.docstr.gwt"

gwt {
    modules ['<YOUR-GWT-MODULE>']
}
```

## Available Tasks

When you apply the GWT Gradle Plugin, the following tasks are added to your
project:

- `gwtCompile`: Compiles your GWT modules. It will be executed automatically
  when you run `gradle build`.
- `gwtDevMode`: Starts GWT Development Mode (Super Dev Mode is enabled by
  default).

For the full list of available options, refer to
the [Configuration](doc/Configuration.md) documentation.

## Version 1 (v1) Plugin

The original GWT Gradle Plugin (v1) source code is still available on
the [v1 branch](https://github.com/jiakuan/gwt-gradle-plugin/tree/v1) of this
repository. Documentation for v1 can be found
at [http://gwt-gradle.docstr.org](http://gwt-gradle.docstr.org).
