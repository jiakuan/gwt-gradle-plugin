= Small GWT App with RPC and JVM Test Suites

This is an example of a GWT application that is using

* GWT RPC
* single Gradle module (client, shared, and server in same source set)
* Legacy Servlet API (instead of Jakarta servlet API)

== Test Run

  ./gradlew tomcatRun  # depends on gwtCompile

Then open http://localhost:8080/app/. The application should work.

If, while the `tomcatRun` is running, you also do

  ./gradlew gwtSuperDev

then you can modify the UI code and reload the app in the browser
for the changes to take effect.

== Test

To run individual test suites:

  .\gradlew test
  .\gradlew gwtMockitoTest
  .\gradlew test5
  .\gradlew integrationTest

Or run them all:

  .\gradlew build # runs all checks

== Build the WAR

  ./gradlew war

Inside the WAR file, the `WEB-INF/lib` contains only

* `gwt-servlet.jar`
