= Small GWT App with RPC

This is an example of a GWT application that is using

 * GWT RPC
 * single Gradle module (client, shared, and server in same source set)
 * Jakarta Servlet API (instead of legacy servlet API)

== Test Run

  ./gradlew tomcatRun  # depends on gwtCompile

Then open http://localhost:8080/app/. The application should work.

If, while the `tomcatRun` is running, you also do

  ./gradlew gwtSuperDev

then you can modify the UI code and reload the app in the browser
for the changes to take effect.

== Build the WAR

  ./gradlew war

Inside the WAR file, the `WEB-INF/lib` contains only

 * `gwt-servlet-jakarta.jar`
